### What I learned

As someone who has been learning front-end web development for only a couple months I was pretty proud of the way it turned out. I did this challenge with just HTML/CSS, no libraries or the like since I wanted to solidify my foundational skills more, plus I have yet to learn the libraries. I learned alot about how I thought through the challenge and how it translated on code. Breaking down each individual element was something that I focused in on because looking at the big picture was something I was more used too. I used many <p> elements and added a different class to every single one of them, which I think there's probably a better way of doing things. I'm pretty proud of myself for keeping my code pretty organized, and I had used variables and try to keep it as DRY as possible, although I think there's still things I can probably make more DRY.

### Continued development

As I move forward I definitely want to make a solid CSS Reset template sheet for myself so I can get right into the nitty-gritty of things. I'm still familirializing myself with display properties and just getting things to line up / spaced well in general, so that's something I'll keep looking out for in future projects.
